## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Smart Bill App up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Python 3.8+** (for the backend)
  * **Flutter SDK** (for the frontend)
  * **Git**

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theuditbhardwaj/smart_bill_app.git
cd theuditbhardwaj-smart_bill_app
```

### 2\. Backend Setup

The backend handles API endpoints for products, customers, and bill processing.

```bash
cd backend
```

**Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If requirements.txt doesn't exist, create it with:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Then manually add:
# fastapi
# uvicorn
# pydantic
# fpdf
# python-dotenv # Recommended for environment variables
```

**Environment Variables for Email (Optional but Recommended)**

For email functionality, it's highly recommended to use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials in `main.py`. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```dotenv
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password # Use an App Password for Gmail!
```

**Important:** If you're using Gmail, you'll likely need to generate an **App Password** as traditional passwords are often blocked for security reasons when used with third-party apps. Refer to Google's documentation for "App passwords".

**Run the Backend Server**

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a Flutter application that interacts with the backend.

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

**Get Flutter Dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**Run the Flutter Application**

Make sure your backend server is running.

```bash
flutter run
```

This will launch the Flutter application on your default configured device (e.g., Chrome for web, an Android emulator, or a desktop application).

## üìù Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running:

  * **Dashboard:**

      * You can **add new products** to your inventory by filling out the product form.
      * You can **add new customers** with their details.
      * Existing products and customers will be listed, and you can **edit** or **delete** products.

  * **Create Bill:**

      * **Select a customer** from the dropdown.
      * **Search for products** and add them to the current bill by specifying the quantity. The app will check for available stock.
      * View the **bill preview** with individual item totals and the grand total.
      * Click "Generate & Send Bill" to create a PDF invoice, update inventory quantities in the backend, record the order, and **send the PDF invoice to the customer's email address**.

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing

You can test the backend API endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or by running the provided `test.py` script:

```bash
# From the 'backend' directory
python test.py
```

**Note:** Ensure you replace the placeholder `customer` and `product` IDs in `test.py` with actual IDs from your `billing_app.db` if you want the test to interact with existing data.
